# Route Visualization Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the route visualization feature for the Urban Transportation Planning Game.

## Overview

Route visualization allows players to see their planned travel routes on the map, providing a more immersive and informative gaming experience. The routes change appearance based on the selected transportation mode and show progress during trips.

## Components and Files

1. **RouteVisualization.ts** - Utility functions for route visualization
   - `generateRoutePath`: Creates a realistic-looking route between two points
   - `addRouteToMap`: Adds a route to the MapLibre GL map with appropriate styling
   - `removeRouteFromMap`: Cleans up route resources
   - `calculateRouteMetrics`: Calculates distance and duration for a route

2. **GameMap.tsx** - Updated to display routes on the map
   - Shows active route when in driving mode
   - Displays historical routes for completed trips
   - Auto-focuses the map to show the current route

3. **DrivingMode.tsx** - Enhanced with real-time progress tracking
   - Calculates and displays time remaining
   - Shows progress along the route
   - Computes trip score based on transport mode and distance

4. **GameContext.tsx** - Updated to store and manage route data
   - Added `activeTrip` to track the current trip
   - Stores transport mode in the context
   - Enhanced the reducer to handle trip-related actions

## How It Works

1. When a player selects an objective, they are presented with the transport selection screen
2. Once a transport mode is chosen, the game enters "driving mode":
   - A route is calculated and displayed on the map
   - The progress bar starts advancing
   - Trip metrics (time, distance) are calculated
3. When the trip completes (or is skipped/canceled):
   - The route is added to the completed trips
   - Points are awarded
   - The objective is marked as completed

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real API Integration**: Replace mock route generation with actual API calls to OpenStreetMap or other routing services
2. **Animated Route Progress**: Show the player's position moving along the route during driving
3. **Route Alternatives**: Offer multiple route options for the same destination
4. **Traffic Simulation**: Add simulated traffic conditions that affect route times
5. **Realistic Trip Calculations**: Calculate trip times and scores based on real-world data

## Known Limitations

1. Routes are currently simulated with a simple algorithm rather than using real map data
2. Progress tracking is linear and doesn't account for varying speeds along different parts of routes
3. The trip simulation is time-based rather than showing actual movement on the map

## Testing

To test the route visualization:
1. Start a new game
2. Select an objective on the map
3. Choose a transport mode
4. Observe the route display and progress tracking
5. Complete several trips to see multiple routes displayed
